# PythonApp-StockPredictor
* Created a tool that allows you to predict stock prices using historical stock data obtained through Yahoo Finance.
* Used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), which is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architecture for time series forecasting.
* Previously, I trained a RNN model to predict stock prices of Alphabet on a Jupyter notebook.
  *Data Cleaning/Visualization (removed null values, train-test split, feature scaling with MinMaxScaler, ...) data visualization with matplotlib)
  *Model Building (RNN model)

* After that, 
* Built a client facing application using Flask, which is a web framework.
